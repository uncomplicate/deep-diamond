    uncomplicate.diamond.tensor
  "Contains type-agnostic general tensor functions. Does not contain functions related
  to deep neural networks (DNN); see the [[dnn]] namespace for these.

  ### How to use

      (ns test
        (:require [uncomplicate.diamond
                   [tensor :refer :all]
                   [native :refer :all]]))

  ### Examples

  The best and most accurate examples can be found in the
  [comprehensive test suite](https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond/tree/master/test/uncomplicate/diamond),
  [full examples](https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond/tree/master/test/uncomplicate/diamond/functional),
  [core tensor examples](https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond/blob/master/test/uncomplicate/diamond/tensor_test.clj)

  [internal CPU engine tests](https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond/tree/master/test/uncomplicate/diamond/internal/dnnl),
  [internal GPU engine tests](https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond/tree/master/test/uncomplicate/diamond/internal/cudnn),


  There are quite a few tutorials [on my blog dragan.rocks](http://dragan.rocks).

  For the comprehensive real-world examples, with detailed tutorials and guides, see the
  [Interactive Programming for Artificial intelligence book series](aiprobook.com), and specifically
  the [Deep Learning for Programmers](https://aiprobook.com/deep-learning-for-programmers) book.

    ### Cheat Sheet

  * Default engine (factory) binding: [[*diamond-factory*]], [[with-diamond]]. All functions can also receive
    engine through parameters.

  * Tensor descriptor: [[desc]], [[shape]], [[layout]], [[data-type]],

  * Create : [[tensor]], [[transformer]], [[batcher]], [[shuffler]]

  * Inspect, transform, and manage tensors: [[view-tz]], [[revert]], [[input]], [[output]],
  [[connector]], [[batch-size]], [[offset!]].


  Tensors support typical core Fluokitten functions.

  "The default factory binding. Most polymorphic functions that have factory

  user has to require a namespace that initializes and binds the default engine. The most common
  way is to require [[uncomplicate.diamond.native]], which binds the DNNL based CPU engine as the default,
  but you are free to provide another implementation of your own, either by this root binding,
  or through Clojure's dynamic binding through [[with-diamond]].
